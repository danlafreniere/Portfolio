            <p>This project is coming soon(ish). But I promise it will be rad when it does. Please check back later for a full build.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: -40px">But First, a Teaser...</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify; margin: 0">A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barn_door_tracker" target="_blank">barn door star tracker</a> is a device that mounts on to a tripod and slowly opens to accurately track the Earth's rotation. This piece of equipment typically allows photographers to take pictures of the stars with pinpoint precision (due to the long exposure times required at night, stars usually have trailing effects). I'm currently in the process of building this using an ardunio and some cool math so that everything is automated. I'm also thinking of integrating an Android application for the control at a later date. Unfortunately technical interview prep slowed me down a wee bit but I plan on adding a full build and blog post about this project on my site when finished!</p>

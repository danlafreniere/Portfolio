        <p>This was my very first coding project and subsequently got me hooked on programming. The Clinical Neuropsych Test Administration System (CNTAS) was a system developed by my former supervisor Dr. Scot Purdon. It's vital for accurately diagnosing patients in his first episode psychosis clinic.</p>

        <p>The CNTAS UI automatically presents patients with a series of questionnaires or cognitive tests preselected by our clinicians.</p>

            <h2>Ugly By Design</h2>
            <p>You might look upon the CNTAS UI and subtly throw up in your mouth a little (and for that I'm sorry) but there's a good reason for it's simplicity. Patients with psychosis have difficulty filtering distracting information. This includes unnecessary colour and movement. Since CNTAS is a clinical tool, the bottom-line is that if it's not necessary it's not there.</p>
            
            <h2 style="margin-top: -30px">The Test Battery</h2>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Beck's Anxiety/Depression Inventories:</strong>  basic questionnaires of true/false questions pertaining to anxiety and depression, respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Drug Questionnaire:</strong> asks about recreational drug habits throughout the patient's lifetime. Follow-up questions are asked depending on answers given.</li>
                <li><strong>Word Memory Test:</strong> word pairs are presented during a training phase. During the test phase, patients are given one word and must recall the corresponding paired word from a multiple choice list.</li>
                <li><strong>Visual Patterns Test:</strong> patients are shown patterns with gradually increasing difficulty and must subsequently reproduce them (pictured to the right).</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 style="margin-top: -30px">Scoring and Output</h2>
            
            <p>Accurate clinical records are incredibly important in healthcare settings. If a patient is misdiagnosed, it can have serious ramifications on their ultimate prognosis. CNTAS is designed to output patient results in text format. These results are later exported into SPSS for statistical analysis and clinician reports. I was required to follow test-specific guidelines to ensure all tests were appropriately marked and pride myself on the quality and accuracy of my work.</p>

<!-- The system automatically scores and outputs information into text files. These files are later processed and send to a database for research and diagnostic purposes. Therefore, all system output had to be as accurate as possible and was subjected to extensive testing. -->

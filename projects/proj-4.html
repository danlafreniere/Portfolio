        <p>The Clinical Neuropsych Test Administration System (CNTAS) was a system developed by my supervisor Dr. Scot Purdon. This test was vital for diagnosing and treating patients in our first episode psychosis clinic. The system consists of a UI that automatically presents patients with a series of questionnaires or cognitive tests preselected by our clnicians.</p>
        
        <p>This was the project that lead me to pursue computing as a career and my subsequent switch from psychology. I developed the system using VB.net during my time at Alberta Hospital Edmonton as a research coordinator.</p>

            <h2>Design and Functionality</h2>
            <p>The design of the system was meant to be as simplistic as possible in order to avoid any confounding factors in the results. Patients with psychosis in particular typically have difficulty filtering distracting information.</p>

            <p>The system automatically scores and outputs information into text files. These files are later processed and send to a database for research and diagnostic purposes. Therefore, all system output had to be as accurate as possible and was subject to extensive testing.</p>

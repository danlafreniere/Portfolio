        <p>Hypertension contributes to a variety of severe health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. Combined with a high prevalence, the disease creates enormous amounts of strain for healthcare practitioners and patients alike. Using data associated with hypertension's contributing factors, I utilized machine learning techniques to predict presence of the disease in a very large sample of patients.</p>
        
        <p>This research is currently being published in the <b><a href="http://ssci2016.cs.surrey.ac.uk/">2016 IEEE Symposium Series in Computational Intelligence</a></b> conference. An official publication is expected shortly.</p>

            <h2>Tools</h2>
            <p>This neural network was not created from scratch. If you want to learn how to do that though, check out the backpropagation post on my blog!</p>
            <p>To save some time and sanity, I used a couple of awesome toolboxes:</p>
            <h3>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>This toolbox is a beast. It allows you to preprocess all of your data, run R-scripts, test, train, and validate your entire project using a series of interconnected drag-and-drop modules. It's the lego of neural networks and pretty much idiot-proof.</p>
            <h3>Matlab Neural Network Toolbox</h3>
            <p>While not as intuitive as the Microsoft toolbox, Matlab still holds its own as a statistical powerhouse. A little more legwork is required in terms of the data preprocessing but scripts can be exported for later use which is a huge plus (to save time for any poor souls that happen to take over the project).</p>

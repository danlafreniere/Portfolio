        <p>Hypertension contributes to a variety of severe health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, and renal failure. Combined with a high prevalence, the disease creates enormous amounts of strain for healthcare systems. Using data associated with hypertension's contributing factors, I utilized machine learning techniques to predict presence of the disease in a very large sample of patients.</p>

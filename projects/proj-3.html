            <p>Ever get sick and tired of the technologically-inept bothering you for advice? Tech Support is an application meant to help solve some of your woes by redirecting these individuals elsewhere. It serves as a simplistic guide for common technological issues experienced in day to day life. In an era where information is endlessly abundant (almost to a fault), we felt that such an app could help offset the frustration of information overload that many people experience when searching for a solution on their own.</p>

            <p>Our app was built by a four person team and was later selected as one of the top 5 projects in the class. As a result, we presented the application in the 2016 Queen's Creative Computing Conference.</p>

            <p><b>Please Note:</b> the TechSupport app was part of a school project as was meant to be a lesson in user interaction and design. The project was limited to the development of a vertical prototype.</p>

            <h2>Design and Functionality</h2>
            <p>The system serves as a troubleshooting guide for simple, everyday problems that normally intimidate the technologically illiterate. It prompts users to answer simple questions in order to narrow down the issue and ultimately guides them to a simple, step-by-step solution</p>
            
            <p>TechSupport is a one-stop-shop for easing digital immigrants into the realm of modern technology without experiencing intimidating information overload. The design features a simple and easy-to-use menu where favorites and common problems can be found and stored. The application's intuitive design includes a calming blue color scheme with universal icons and easy-to-read text.</p>

            <h2>Limitations and Barriers</h2>
            <p>While the system serves as a sort of technological dictionary, the problem space is simply too broad in order to adequately code it without substantial resources. Reading in json data from a variety of other sources would also be useful but was ignored for similar reasons.</p>

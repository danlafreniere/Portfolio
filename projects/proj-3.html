            <p>Ever get sick and tired of the technologically-inept bothering you for advice? Tech Support is an application meant to help solve some of your woes by redirecting these individuals elsewhere. It serves as a simplistic guide for common technological issues experienced in day to day life. In an era where information is endlessly abundant (almost to a fault), we felt that such an app could help offset the frustration of information overload that many people experience when searching for a solution on their own.</p>

            <p>Our app was built by a four person team and was later selected as one of the top 5 projects in the class. As a result, we presented the application in the 2016 Queen's Creative Computing Conference.</p>

            <p><b>Please Note:</b> the TechSupport app was part of a school project as was meant to be a lesson in user interaction and design. The project was limited to the development of a vertical prototype.</p>

                    <h2>Design and Functionality</h2>
                    <p>The system serves as a troubleshooting guide for simple, everyday problems that normally intimidate the technologically illiterate. It prompts users to answer simple questions in order to narrow down the issue and ultimately guides them to a simple, step-by-step solution</p>

                    <p>TechSupport is a one-stop-shop for easing digital immigrants into the realm of modern technology without experiencing intimidating information overload. The design features a simple and easy-to-use menu where favorites and common problems can be found and stored. The application's intuitive design includes a calming blue color scheme with universal icons and easy-to-read text.</p>

                    <h3>UX Process</h3>
                    <p>We followed the entire UX process starting with group brainstorming sessions for potential application ideas. Once we decided on TechSupport, personas were developed in order to get a better idea of how our target demographic might use the application. A hierarchical task inventory was then created to determine general application flow followed by a conceptual outline of the application examining interaction, emotional, and ecological perspectives.</p>

                    <p>The next phase of app development involved development of user flows to determine how users would go about solving various problems using our application. We decided on common problems often experienced by technologically inept users (such as how to handle software updates or install phone applications). JustinMind software was then used to develop our initial wireframes and prototypes prior to app development using the Android Studio IDE.</p>

                    <p>In the final phase of development, we tested our vertical prototype with users around campus. We then tweaked our application based on user data collected at this time.</p>


                    <h3>Limitations and Barriers</h3>
                    <p>While the system serves as a sort of technological dictionary, the problem space is simply too broad in order to adequately code it without substantial resources. Reading in json data from a variety of other sources would also be useful but was ignored for similar reasons.</p>

        <p>Ever get sick and tired of the technologically-inept bothering you for advice? Tech Support is an application meant to help solve some of your woes by redirecting these individuals elsewhere. It serves as a simplistic guide for common technological issues experienced in day to day life. In an era where information is endlessly abundant (almost to a fault), we felt that such an app could help offset the frustration of information overload that many people experience when searching for a solution on their own.</p>
        
        <p>Our app was built by a four person team and was later selected as one of the top 5 projects in the class. As a result, we presented the application in the 2016 Queen's Creative Computing Conference.</p>
        
        <p><b>Please Note:</b> the TechSupport app was part of a school project as was meant to be a lesson in user interaction and design rather than a practical or fully functional piece of software.</p>

            <h2>Design and Functionality</h2>
            <p>Queen's University is an institution that prides itself on tradition and excellence. In order to help convey these traits, strict visual guidelines must be followed for all content associated with the institution's brand. As a developer on the ITS team, I was tasked with providing clients with a site meeting the functional requirements of their respective faculties while adhering to these visual identity standards. It was an essential experience to learn about company branding and helping client's tailor their needs within the restrictions of a company's brand.</p>

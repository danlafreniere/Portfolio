            <h1>SO WHAT ARE WE EVEN DOING AT THIS POINT?</h1>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Right now all you really know is that we are building some vague application called TeamWhipper without much idea of what it will actually do. That kinda sucks, I know, but I've intentionally kept it vague so that we can focus more on the fine details of the project and really dive into what each line of code is doing. Parts of the project will be revealed as we progress - I figure it's the best way to focus on small pieces at a time and avoid information overload.</p>
            
            <p class="bigBottom">Alright, air cleared? Everyone chill? Solid.</p>
                
            <p>So now that we're on the same page and the App.js file is set up, we're going to create a basic landing page with a welcome message and a get started button. This will involve creating a very basic view and controller. Nothing special, but it will introduce some new concepts and better familiarize you with the MVC framework. The <a href="https://github.com/danlafreniere/BlogPosts/tree/master/MEAN">github template</a> I linked to in the last part already has a "getStarted.ejs" view and corresponding css styling pre-packaged. <b>Please note that I won't be covering any HTML (outside of what's needed for Angular) or css styling so it's essential to download these files if you want to code along.</b></p> 
        </div>

        <div class="container floatClear bigBottom"> 
            
            <p>We are going to jump ahead a bit in the app and create a simple page that allows us to add team members to our database and list these members' names underneath as they are added:</p>
            
            <img style="margin: 40px auto" alt="Screenshot of the create team page - includes fields for name, email, mobile, and team role" class="img-responsive" src="../../assets/images/Post_MEAN/Team_Builder.png"/>
            
            <p>It's a lot like the to-do app example in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-7RQ46RgxU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp">NetNinja tutorial series</a> that I linked to in Part 1. The only difference is that we will be implementing our Team Member list using Angular while making our app RESTful (among some other things).</p>
            
            <p>So first things first...</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container floatClear bigBottom">     
            <h1>WHAT ARE RESTful API'S?</h1>
            
            <p>So I personally found a lot of this stuff to be pretty convoluted but I'll try and break it down as best as I can. An API stands for "Application Programming Interface" and what it really does is allow one piece of software to talk to another.</p>
            
            <p>Here are some examples of popular API's:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library?project=fit-asset-115001">Google</a>
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public">Twitter</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript">Facebook</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Or just check out this <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis">massive API directory</a>.</p>
            
            <p>To be a little more specific, these are RESTful API's. REST stands for <strong>RE</strong>presentational <strong>S</strong>tate <strong>T</strong>ransfer. So what the hell does that even mean? It's basically an architectural style/abstraction for designing network applications. More specifically it's a generally agreed upon set of principles or constraints. In virtually all RESTful web applications, HTTP is used to make calls between machines - HTTP requests are made to post data (POST), read data (GET), and delete data (DELETE). This is all you really need to know right now but if you want to read more, check out <a href="http://rest.elkstein.org/">this resource</a>.</p>
            
            <p>In order to make this member list page work, we are going to need to POST data that the client enters in the form to the server. We also need to GET member data from the server in order to display the list of added team members back to the client.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container floatClear bigBottom">     
            <h1>MongoDB</h1>
            
            <p>Before we make any of the HTTP calls, we need to get our database ready. In order to save a little time with MongoDB logistics. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4OP8JGKbQU&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9gcy9lrvMJ75z9maRw4byYp&index=35">this video</a> which will show you how to set up your MongoDB server using <a href="https://mlab.com/">mLab</a>. Once you are finished, you should have a couple lines in your server.js file that look something like this:</p>
            
            <pre class="codeBlockSmall" style="max-width: 840px; max-height: 140px;">
                <code class="language-java">
    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://test:test@ds031213.mlab.com:31213/team-whipper');
                </code>
            </pre> 
            
             <p>Let's start by making a file called "apiRoutes.js" within the included "app" folder. This is where we will make GET/POST/DELETE HTTP calls to the server side.</p>
            
<!--
            <h1>A LITTLE SELF CONTROL</h1>

            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">In the previous episode, we had a few lines in our App.js file regarding controllers. This part in particular is important: "require('./controllers/initialize')". This means that we are going to need a controller called "initialize.js" in the controllers folder of our project. And since we required this file and called it as a method with an application object argument in our App.js file ("initializationController(app)"), we need to explicitly export it so nothing breaks:</p>
            
            <pre class="codeBlockSmall" style="max-width: 410px; max-height: 160px;">
                <code class="language-java">
    module.exports = function(app){
    
    };
                </code>
            </pre> 
            
            
            <p>Within this little block of code, we can start setting up routes. The first route we are going to create is one that will render our getStarted.ejs view when the home path is visited ("/"). To do this, we make use of the passed in application object and make a get() call with a callback function that takes request and response objects as parameters. Like so:</p>
            
             <pre class="codeBlockSmall" style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 200px;">
                <code class="language-java">
    module.exports = function(app){
        app.get('/', function(req, res){
            res.render('getStarted');
        });
    };
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Now, run your server by navigating to the location of your app.js file on your hard drive using a linux shell, type "nodemon app" and hit enter. Navigate to "localhost:3000" in your browser and you should see a happy little lander page (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLO7tCdBVrA" target="_blank">Bob Ross would be proud</a>):</p>
            
            <img style="margin: 40px auto" alt="Screenshot of landing page saying: let's get your team up to shape. Includes a button saying: get started" class="img-responsive" src="../../assets/images/Post_MEAN/Happy_Little_Lander.png"/>
            
            <h2>BUTTON FUNCTIONALITY</h2>
            
            <p>It doesn't do us much good if we have a "Get Started" button that leads nowhere though so let's redirect to a new page when clicked using this same controller and routes.</p>
            
             <pre class="codeBlockSmall" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 170px;">
                <code class="language-java">
    app.get('/createTeam', function(req, res){
      res.render('createTeam');
    });
                </code>
            </pre>
            
            <p>Alright, so now should be redirected to a new view when the Get Started button is clicked:</p>

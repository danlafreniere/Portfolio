    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>

    <p>I'm a recent graduate of the second-degree Computing program at Queen's University and I'm currently preparing for job interviews after taking some time off. I will be available for hire beginning January 2017.
    </p>
    
    <p>I  recently worked as a freelancer during my time at Queen's after obtaining clients from my summer position with IT Services. My current side projects involve a team management MEAN-stack web application called "TeamWhipper", an automated star tracker with accompanying Android app, and this portfolio site! You can read more about my past and present projects below.
    </p>
    
    <p>I'm told I'm a very nice fella so don't hesitate to <a href="#jumpto-Contact">drop me a line!</a>
    </p>

    <p>My first degree in psychology was obtained from the University of Alberta. I spent a number
        of years in the field of clinical neuropsychology where I studied human cognition and abnormal brain structure 
        in patients suffering from schizophrenia via patient testing and MRI acquisition. Though I loved the field, 
        I found myself spending a lot of my free time coding and decided that I should follow my heart and pursue 
        computer science. My passions lie in artificial intelligence, software development and app/web development 
        but I love learning new skills and facing the rewarding challenges that computer science presents to me every day.
    </p>

    <p>I'm a huge music fan and dig everything from metal to dream pop. When I have time 
        I love travelling wherever the wind takes me or working on many of my growing side projects. I also 
        enjoy kayaking, bouldering, snowboarding, and hiking in the mountains in my free time. My personal goals
        involve learning night photography, how to fly a helicopter, getting a dog, and building a smart home with A.I. integration.

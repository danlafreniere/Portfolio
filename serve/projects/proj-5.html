        <p>Over the summer of 2015 I developed a series of websites for faculties across Queen's University using Drupal. I maintained regular contact with clients in order to ensure faculty-specific needs were being met. Each project required adherance to Queen's University styling guidelines in order to maintain institutional branding while simultaneously developing a website unique to each faculty. I was able to develop subsequent freelance contracts with each of my clients as a result of my superior attention to detail and ability to develop strong rapport with these individuals. Prior to my departure, I trained a faculty member from each department in order to ensure that the site could be adequately maintained independently.</p>

            <h2>Queen's Visual Identity</h2>
            <div class="col-left">
                <p>Queen's University is an institution that prides itself on tradition and excellence. In order to help convey these traits, strict visual guidelines must be followed for all content associated with the institution's brand. As a developer on the ITS team, I was tasked with providing clients with a site meeting the functional requirements of their respective faculties while adhering to these visual identity standards. It was an essential experience to learn about company branding and helping client's tailor their needs within the restrictions of a company's brand.</p>

                <h2>Queen's Geography and Planning</h2>

                <p>The geography and planning department was an interesting project due to the consolidation of the geography faculty and school of urban and regional planning while I was tasked with developing the site. In order to ensure a smooth merge, constant communication was required between collaborators. The sometimes conflicting needs of each group meant that a balance had to be struck between aesthetic and ensuring both groups could continue to function optimally.</p>

                <p>The Queen's Advancement site is primarily used by the advancement and alumni teams as well as alumni and benefactors. The site is meant to be simple and allow for easy access to important documents such as fundraising reports or campaigning information.</p>

                <h2>Queen's Alumni - Travel</h2>

                <p>Due to the overwhelming sense of community at Queen's University, the Alumni site is arguably one of the most vital aspects of Queen's overall web presence. The Alumni branch provides outreach and fundraising to the University while offering unique services to alumni across the world. This site was developed by a third party company based out of Kingston. I primarily took on the role of an internal consultant during development of the site. I also had the pleasure of designing the Queen's Alumni travel pages, training faculty, and loading content using the Drupal content management system.</p>

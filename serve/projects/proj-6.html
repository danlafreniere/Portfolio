        <p>I'm currently in the process of developing a web application using a MEAN stack framework in order to better learn the process. This application is being designed with university group projects in mind. The current plan is to provide an application that lets team members do things like: keep in contact with one another using group/individual chats, brainstorm, rate one another, set up events/tasks, schedule deadlines, and track project progress.</p>
        
        <p>The UX process will be outlined below shortly and will include working application screenshots as well as a demo.</p>

            <p>This neural network was not created from scratch. If you want to learn how to do that though, check out the backpropagation post on my blog!</p>
            <p>To save some time and sanity, I used a couple of awesome toolboxes:</p>
            <h3>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>This toolbox is a beast. It allows you to preprocess all of your data, run R-scripts, test, train, and validate your entire project using a series of interconnected drag-and-drop modules. It's the lego of neural networks and pretty much idiot-proof.</p>
            <h3>Matlab Neural Network Toolbox</h3>
            <p>While not as intuitive as the Microsoft toolbox, Matlab still holds its own as a statistical powerhouse. A little more legwork is required in terms of the data preprocessing but scripts can be exported for later use which is a huge plus (to save time for any poor souls that happen to take over the project).</p>
